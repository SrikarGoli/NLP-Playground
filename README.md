# NLP Techniques and Sentiment Classifier

This repository contains multiple Jupyter notebooks showcasing key Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a small project on text classification and sentiment analysis.

---

## üìÅ Notebooks Included

- `Chunking.ipynb`  
  ‚û§ Phrase chunking using POS tags and regex patterns (NLTK).

- `Parsing.ipynb`  
  ‚û§ Syntax parsing using context-free grammars and dependency trees.

- `Taggers.ipynb`  
  ‚û§ POS tagging using different NLTK taggers and accuracy comparisons.

- `Encoding.ipynb`  
  ‚û§ Text preprocessing and encoding methods (One-hot, TF-IDF, etc.).

- `word2vec,fasttext.ipynb`  
  ‚û§ Word embeddings using Word2Vec and FastText (Gensim).
     also now there are many context based embeddings from BERT, GPT, ELMo which are very much usfull

- `Text classification and Sentiment analysis.ipynb`  
  ‚û§ A mini-project implementing supervised learning for sentiment prediction on text data.
     I used GRU, LSTM, But we can use modern things like GPT, BERT, ELmo also.
